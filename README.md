This is a small command-line app that, given a menu and a price, calculates a combination of dishes that total to that price.

You will need the [Leiningen](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen) build tool installed to run the developer environment.

Once installed, enter the project directory and execute the program with `lein run` or the test suite with `lein test`

It will load the file found at `resources/menu.txt` taking the first line as the target price and each other line as an individual menu item.

A Java jar file can be generated by running `lein uberjar` or downloaded from [here.](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B_onxYR_-e6ASlFPLXRTY1kyMFE)

This is a solution to an NP-complete problem, so the execution time will grow _very_ quickly as the target price or menu length increases.
